This is a very basic question and seems simple, but when you start thinking, you might get lost in lots of answers or no answer.
The truth is, there is no one answer to this question. Computers were present even before the transistor, in theoretical and mechanical forms.


In the early 19th century, the term "computer" referred to humans who could solve calculations by hand or with the help of simple mechanical devices. 
Over time, the definition evolved to includes mechanical and electromechanical devices, such as the abacus, the Antikythera mechanism, and later, devices like the Babbage Engine and Hollerith's tabulating machines.

It was the scientist Alan Turing, known as the father of the modern computer, who described a machine that was termed the Turing Machine. 
Every computer that we use today, from the computer or cell phone you are reading this on to supercomputers, can be classified as a Turing Machine at their most simplistic level.
