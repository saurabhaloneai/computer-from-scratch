this is a very basic question and seems simple, but when you start thinking, you might get lost in lots of answers or no answer.
the truth is, there is no one answer to this question. the definition of a computer has changed a lot over time. 
computers were present even before the transistor, in theoretical and mechanical forms. as technology evolved, so did computer and its definition.

### historical evolution

in the early 19th century, the term "computer" referred to humans who could solve calculations by hand or with the help of simple mechanical devices. 

time passed and the [definition-evolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware) to include mechanical and electromechanical devices, such as the abacus, the antikythera mechanism, and later, devices like the babbage engine and hollerith's tabulating machines.

### the turing machine

it was the scientist alan turing, known as the father of the modern computer science, who described a machine that was named the turing machine. 

a turing machine is a simple, theoretical device invented by the mathematician alan turing in 1936 to help understand the limits of what can be computed.

imagine it like this:

1. **tape**: picture an infinitely long strip of paper (the tape) divided into small squares. each square can hold a symbol (like a 0 or 1).
2. **head**: there is a read/write head that moves along the tape, one square at a time. it can read the symbol in the current square, write a new symbol, and then move left or right.
3. **state**: the machine is always in one of a finite number of states. based on the current state and the symbol it reads, it will write a new symbol, move the head, and switch to a new state according to a set of rules (the program).

using these simple actions, a turing machine can perform any computation that can be algorithmically defined. this concept is fundamental because it helps define what it means for a problem to be computable and is the basis for modern computer science.
a problem is count computable if there exists a turing machine that can solve it. 
this definition helps differentiate between problems that can be solved by an algorithm (computable problems) and those that cannot (non-computable problems).

### modern computers

every computer that we use today, from the computer or cell phone you are reading this on to supercomputers, can come under the turing machine at their most simplistic level.

at its core, a computer is a machine that processes data by executing a set of instructions, known as algorithms, to perform calculations, manipulate information, and solve problems.


## how a computer work ?

the real question is do u really need to know how computers work under the hood? the answer is no, but that's when the real beauty of building from scratch kicks in.
after understanding 'how,' ur whole experience changes. the next time u run up a program, it's not just clicking an icon anymore. you'll see ur input going through each layer of the computer like a signal to output.
it's not just about the tech stuff either. you'll start to appreciate the genius of the people who built all this. and let's be real, there's a bit of a godlike feeling when u know what's happening in every microchip and line of code.
the coolest part? that mind-blowing moment when it all clicks. when u see the big picture of how ur simple mouse click sets off this crazy chain reaction in the machine. that feeling is like solving a massive puzzle or hard leetcode problem. it's a rush that's hard to put into words, but once u feel it, you're hooked for life.
so yeah, u don't need to know all this stuff. but once u do, it's like seeing the matrix. u can't unsee it, and trust me, u won't want to.

the whole premise of building a computer is to understand how it works. i might not be able to give an in-depth explanation now, but here's an overview:
as a programmer, i've tried to understand the workings of a computer in terms of how my program gets executed and generates output.


#### lets write a simple c code


1. c code :


```c
swap(int v[], int k) {
    int temp;
    temp = v[k];
    v[k] = v[k+1];
    v[k+1] = temp;
}
```

this is a function that swaps two adjacent elements in an array.

2. compiler:
the compiler takes this high-level code(c code) and translates it into assembly language.

3. assembly code:

```assembly
swap:
    mult $2, $5, 4      # $2 = k * 4 (find the byte offset for index k)
    add  $2, $4, $2     # $2 = address of v + byte offset (get address of v[k])
    lw   $15, 0($2)     # load the value at v[k] into $15
    lw   $16, 4($2)     # load the value at v[k+1] into $16
    sw   $16, 0($2)     # store the value of v[k+1] into the address of v[k]
    sw   $15, 4($2)     # store the value of v[k] into the address of v[k+1]
    jr   $31            # return to the calling function
```

this is a lower-level representation of the same functionality, using specific cpu instructions and registers.

4. assembler:
the assembler takes the assembly code and converts it into binary machine code.

5. binary machine code:
the final step shows the binary representation that the computer's cpu can directly execute. each line represents a 32-bit instruction in binary format.
the one we are going to build will represent in 16-bit.

this is just an overview of how code gets executed. we haven't covered how everything happens on the hardware side to execute code,
so the goal is to come back here after building 16-bit hack computer and will talk about how everthing happens [under-the-hood](https://peterhigginson.co.uk/lmc/?F5=28-Jul-24_14:28:21).
