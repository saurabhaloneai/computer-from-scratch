# Overview

I explored lots of resources for building a computer from first principles, but most were either unstructured or too complex to get easily.

I've decided to follow the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) and [FromTheTransitor](https://www.fromthetransistor.com/) since I prefer to focus less on electronics. In the future, I might explore the [Ben Eater](https://eater.net) way.
