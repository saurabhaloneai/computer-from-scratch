## Overview

I explored lots of resources for building a computer from first principles, but most were either unstructured or too complex to get easily.

I've decided to follow the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) and [FromTheTransitor](https://www.fromthetransistor.com/`) since I prefer to focus less on electronics. In the future, I might explore the [Ben Eater](https://eater.net) way.

### What is a hack-computer ?

It is 16-bit computer that you build from scratch as part of the Nand2Tetris course.

It is the simpler to build but fully functional.

You start building with basic logic gates all the way to working computer.

#### Architecture of hack-computer 

1. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: This is the core of the computer that performs arithmetic and logical operations.

2. **Registers**: These are small, fast storage locations that hold data and instructions temporarily.

3. **Memory**: This includes both data memory (RAM) and instruction memory (ROM), where programs and data are stored.

4. **Instruction Set**: This is a set of commands that the computer can execute, defining its capabilities and operations.
